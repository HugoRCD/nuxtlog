# NuxtLog

Give your project a beautiful changelog, newsletters, etc... in seconds, powered by Nuxt Content, NuxtLog is a lightweight, free and open source template for your content made with [Vue](https://vuejs.com), [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com). It leverages [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com) for your feed which allows you to write markdown and use them as a CMS in Nuxt Studio. It has a beautiful UI and is easy to use.
But most importantly, it embeds the new Resend Broadcast feature, which allows you to send your content to your users by email and keep them up to date with your project.
