Thrilled to announce the launch of NuxtLog ðŸŽ‰

![social-preview](/posts/social-preview.png)

NuxtLog is a lightweight, free and open source template for your changelog made with [Vue](https://vuejs.com), [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org) and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com). It leverages [Nuxt Content] for your feed which allows you to write markdown and use them as a CMS. It has a beautiful UI and is easy to use.

NuxtLog also supports code syntax highlighting as well

```js{1,3-5}[server.js]
// Javascript
const url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/";
async function fetchPosts() {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  console.log(response);
}
```

Support for inline code blocks is also available example `const name = "John Doe"`{lang="js"}
