# Blanked 0.0.1 is out !

Blanked is a Nuxt module to improve your Nuxt workflow. It's a simple module to add everything you need to your Nuxt app, including:

TailwindCSS
- Color Mode, add a color mode switcher to your app (dark/light or custom)
- Icons, add every icons from your favorite icon pack (Heroicons and Lucide are pre-installed)
Thanks to @egoist/tailwindcss-icons plugin, only the icons you use in your app will be bundled in your CSS. However, you need to install the icon collections you specified in the blanked.icons key:
